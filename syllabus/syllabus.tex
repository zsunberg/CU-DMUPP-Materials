\title{ASEN 6519: Advanced Survey of Sequential Decision Making}
\author{Zachary Sunberg}
\date{Fall 2023}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\section*{Prerequisites}

ASEN 5264 Decision Making under Uncertainty, research experience in robotics or artificial intelligence, or permission from the instructor.

\section*{Learning Objectives}

\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
    \item Obtain a broad understanding of models and algorithms for sequential decision making
    \item Understand theoretical tools for analyzing sequential decision making
    \item Communicate about recent research in sequential decision making
    \item Become familiar with and investigate open research questions in sequential decision making
\end{enumerate}

\section*{List of Topics}

\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
    \item Applications of sequential decision-making algorithms in fields such as aerospace, robotics, medicine, and ecology.
    \item Survey of popular reinforcement learning algorithms
    \item Theoretical tools for characterizing sequential decision-making algorithms
    \item Important properties of select algorithms
    \item Advanced online and offline algorithms for solving POMDPs and Games
    \item Guest Lectures related to model learning, game theory, and deep learning reliability
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Assignments and Grading}

\textbf{50\% Presentations.}
Each student will read and prepare presentations for three papers that will be assigned after the first week. For each paper there will be three requirements:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item Draft presentation: Must be uploaded several days before the date of the presentation - see ed for details.
    \item In-class presentation and discussion: You will deliver a 20-25 minute presentation summarizing the paper and lead a 10-15 minute discussion.
    \item Two practice exercises to help fellow students prepare for the midterms and form the basis for quiz questions.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{10\% Quizzes.}
There will be three quizzes that will test your understanding of the previous block of presentations.

\textbf{35\% Final Project.}
A final project chosen by the student that ideally connects to their research. Deliverables will be a 15 minute presentation and a 4-8 page report. The project may be completed in teams of up to 2.

\textbf{5\% Participation.}
Students are expected to attend all lectures except for approved reasons such as travel, illness, or religious observances. You will also be expected to ask questions and participate in discussions during the semester.

\section*{Learning Technology}

\textbf{Ed} (\href{https://edstem.org/us/courses/45361}{edstem.org/us/courses/45361}) will be the main hub for the course. A detailed schedule will be posted there.
\textbf{Gradescope} (\url{gradescope.com}) will host assignments.
